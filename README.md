# Asymptotic-Analysis-of-Sorting-Algorithms

Three different sorting algorithms are implemented in Python. The algorithms can be run on data of different sizes and types to analyze the results to see how their run times compare. The algorithms are:
* Quick sort
* Insertion sort
* Selection sort

Run from command line with parameters to select which sorting algorithm, size, and type of data (sorted, constant, or random).
#### Examples
```
python sorting.py q 100000 s (quicksort with 100000 sorted elements)
python sorting.py i 1000 c (insertion sort with 1000 constant elements)
python sorting.py s 1000000 r (selection sort with 1000000 random elements)
```
